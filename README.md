Unzip the zip file and run the script inside the folder.

The folder contains the script and a folder where you should store the csv files from 

https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/road-safety-open-data

Each csv is under "Latest 5 years of data"

The script outside the folder is the same as whats inside but should be ran where the "csv-last-5-years" folder is present
